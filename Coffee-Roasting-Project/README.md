This is the coffee roasting project!

### Overview
It is a simple project based on a small Neural Network, that will predict whether after roasting the given coffee bean, will it still be edible or burnt. So for this we will be using tools like Tensorflow and Keras for designing and training out model.

For this model we will be considering 2 parameters: The two features are Temperature in Celsius and Duration in minutes. The ideal duration for roasting is best kept between 12 and 15 minutes while the temp should be between 175 and 260 degrees Celsius. Of course, as temperature rises, the duration should shrink.
