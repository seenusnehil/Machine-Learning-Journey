# Machine Learning Journey
Hi guys, starting from November 1, 2022, I'll we starting my 365 days of Machine Learning challenge and push myself to learn daily on a regular basis.
If you're too a machine learning enthusiast then lets join hands and learn together. The fun part is that we all v=can share, collaborate and learn together.

## Little background
I have been doing machine learning for quite a long time, and currently working on Neural networks. Though I have done quite a few things in ML, I'll restart everything br revising concepts from scratch.

## About the repository
This repository will be open sourced, that means you all can interact with my commits, go through it and if you feel to improve the content at any point, you all acn contribute to it.
 In this repository, I'll be having:
1. All the projects I'll be working on.
2. My daily updates of 365 days learning of ML
 
## About me
